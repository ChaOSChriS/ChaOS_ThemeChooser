ChaOS_ThemeChooser
==================

Theme Chooser app for ChaOS Rom

Base App:
Read themes from an webdatabase (xml) (Name/Description/Screenshot/Downloadlink) 
Provide an UI to download and install the theme (Reboot to recovery)
Save feature (App runs only on ypgi1)


How To Compile:

If you want to compile this you need to configure the Webdatabase string (AndroidXMLParsing -> static final String URL = "server/theme database xml" )
replace this "server/theme database xml" with your server path to the xml.
